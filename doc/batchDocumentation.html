 GMFFExportTheorem command.
 
 <pre>
 - Optional. Primarily used for testing. Exports Proof Worksheet
             file(s) from the loaded Metamath database using
             the current parameter settings (export parms, escapes, etc.)
 
             May appear anywhere after the "LoadFile" RunParm,
             but should appear after Proof Assistant parameters
             initialized if the default Proof Assistant settings
             are not used.
 
  - Default = N/A -- used for batch testing.
 
  - Value1 = theorem label or "*" (all). If theorem label
             input then it is the starting point of the
             export process, which will export the Max
             Number of files beginning at that label.
             If "*" input then the export begins at the
             first label. Either way, files are exported
             in MObj.seq number -- i.e. by order of appearance
             in the loaded Metamath database (LogicalSystem.)
 
  - Value2 = Max Number of proofs to export. Required.
 
  - Value3 = Append File Name. Name of output file minus
             the file type. Optional. If specified must
             not contain any whitespace characters, or '/'
             or '\' or ':' characters (for safety.) All
             exported Proof Worksheets will be appended
             to the named file (written at the end instead
             of the beginning.) Used for regression testing.
 
      - Examples:
         *       1         2         3         4

 GMFFExportFromFolder command.
 
 <pre>
 - Optional. Primarily used for testing. Exports Proof Worksheet
             file(s) from a given directory using the current
             parameter settings (export parms, escapes, etc.)
 
             May appear anywhere after the "LoadFile" RunParm,
             but should appear after Work Var allocations, at
             least.
 
  - Default = N/A -- used for batch testing.
 
  - Value1 = directory containing Proof Worksheet files
 
  - Value2 = theorem label or "*" (all). If theorem label
             input then it is the starting point of the
             export process, which will export the Max
             Number of files beginning at that label.
             If "*" input then the export begins at the
             first label. Either way, files are exported
             in lexicographic order -- i.e. alphabetically.
 
  - Value3 = file type of input Proof Worksheet files
             (normally either .mmp or .mmt)
 
  - Value4 = Max Number of proofs to export. Required.
 
  - Value5 = Append File Name. Name of output file minus
             the file type. Optional. If specified must
             not contain any whitespace characters, or '/'
             or '\' or ':' characters (for safety.) All
             exported Proof Worksheets will be appended
             to the named file (written at the end instead
             of the beginning.) Used for regression testing.

/
 GMFFParseMetamathTypesetComment command.
 
 <pre>
 - Optional. Primarily used for testing. Executes
             standalone parse of a single Metamath $t comment
             (does not affect the state of GMFF or anything
             else -- except Messages.)
 
             NOTE: the input file should contain only
             the $t comment!
 
             May appear anywhere after the "LoadFile" RunParm.
             (Although it is "standalone" and affects only the
             Messages and GMFFManager objects, the LoadFile
             command creates the LogicalSystem object which holds
             the GMFFManager object.)
 
             A dump of the parse results is generated along with
             statistics. The dump is in the form of a very long
             "info" message.
 
  - Default = N/A -- used for batch testing.
 
  - Value1 = Typesetting Definition Keyword in .mm file
              (in the $t typesetting comment) to be selected
             for parsing.
 
  - Value2 = directory containing MM file
 
  - Value3 = Metamath .mm file containing just a $t comment.
 
 
  - Value4 -  "PRINT" or spaces.
   - Optional
   - Prints the input file as well as the parsed symbols and
     their definitions (replacement text.)
 
      - Examples:
         *       1         2         3         4

/
 GMFFInitialize command.
 
 <pre>
 - Optional. Forces initialization or re-initialization
             using whatever GMFF RunParm options, default
             settings and Metamath $t typesetting definitions have
             been input.
        - NOTE: GMFFInitialize prints an audit message showing the final set
        of parms in effect: selected Exporter ExportParms,
        UserTextEscapes and UserExportChoice ... plus
        typeset definition symbol counts by def keyword.
 
  - The audit report is printed only if GMFF initialization is
    successful.
 
  - May appear anywhere after the "LoadFile" RunParm
    but preferably the GMFF RunParms -- if used at
    all -- appear just prior to starting the Proof
    Assistant. For testing purposes, if input Proof
    Worksheet files are used and they contain Work
    Variables then the GMFF RunParms should appear
    after the WorkVar RunParms.
 
 - If GMFFInitialize is not used then initialization
   takes place only if/when the first GMFF export is
   attempted. Reinitialization can occur if one or
   more additional LoadFile commands have executed
   since initialization and new Metamath $t typsetting
   definitions have been input. (And of course, the
   "Clear" RunParms resets all state variables, which
   would force reinitialization if additional LoadFile
   commands and GMFF export processing were to occur.)
 
 - Initialization may result in error messages about
   the contents of the input .mm Metamath file's $t
   typesetting commands, as well as any other start-up
   errors from GMFF.)
 
  - Default = N/A -- GMFF initialization is automatic.
 
 
 - Value1 -  "PrintTypesettingDefinitions" or spaces.
   - Optional
   - Prints the defined symbols and their definitions (replacement
     text.)
 
 
      - Examples:
         *       1         2         3         4

/
 GMFFUserExportChoice command.
 
 <pre>
 - Optional:
   - These "escapes" convert certain output text characters
     to an alternative character sequence that represents
     the escaped text characters in the output language
     (e.g. html).
 
 - Value1 - Export Type (Unicode or .gif).
   - Defaults: althtml and html
   - Must match the Export Type on one of the GMFFExportParms
     RunParms or the default GMFFExportParms
 
      - Examples ("ALL" is the default):
         *       1         2         3         4
         *234567890123456789012345678901234567890

/
 GMFFUserTextEscapes command.
 <pre>
 - Optional:
   - These "escapes" convert certain output text characters
     to an alternative character sequence that represents
     the escaped text characters in the output language
     (e.g. html).
 
     - Escapes are necessary because certain text characters
       which may be used in a Proof Worksheet have special,
       non-text significance in html. Characters such as '&',
     '>', '<', etc. are used in the html language.
 
     - The space character is escaped into "&nbsp;" so that
       Proof Worksheet text spacing is maintained (otherwise
       browsers would collapse or ignore output spaces in
       certain situations.)
 
 - Value1 - Export Type (Unicode or .gif).
   - Defaults: althtml and html
   - Must match the Export Type on one of the GMFFExportParms
     RunParms or the default GMFFExportParms
 
 - ValueN - Decimal number of Metamath ASCII character
            to be "escaped" in the output html file.
 - ValueN+1
          - Character string to replace escaped character.
 
 - Default Escape Pairs (for both html and althtml):
   -  32 (' ') -> "&nbsp;"
   -  34 ('"') -> "&quot;"
   -  38 ('&') -> "&amp;"
   -  60 ('<') -> "&lt;"
   -  62 ('>') -> "&gt;"
 
 - NOTE: User Text to be "escaped" is whatever text
         in the Proof Worksheet is not "typeset" using
         the Metamath $t typesetting definitions --
         and any mmj2 Proof Worksheet text stored in
         a \models directory (e.g. Proof Worksheet Header
         text contains both "<" and ">", which are stored
         in the \models directory in escaped format
         (so it does not need to be escaped again.)
 
      - Examples (these are the defaults):
         *       1         2         3         4
         *234567890123456789012345678901234567890

/
 GMFFExportParms command.
 
 <pre>
 
 - Optional. Default values are shown above. Modifications
   to the defaults as well as additional settings for new
   export types are made with this RunParm. Validation is
   deferred until GMFF Initialization except for the number
   of RunParm parameters -- i.e. use of this RunParm does not
   trigger GMFF Initialization.
 
 - May appear anywhere after the "LoadFile" RunParm
   but preferably the GMFF RunParms -- if used at
   all -- appear just prior to starting the Proof
   Assistant. For testing purposes, if input Proof
   Worksheet files are used and they contain Work
   Variables then the GMFF RunParms should appear
   after the WorkVar RunParms.
 
 - Value1     = Export Type (Unicode or .gif)
   - defaults: althtml and html
   - Export Type must be unique. It is the key in the export
     parms (and text escapes) lists built using default
     settings merged with the input RunParms GMFFExportParms
     entries.
   - A second GMFFExportParms RunParm with the same Export
     Type updates the first.
 
 - Value2     = on/off
   - default ON
   - ON or OFF to enable/disable this export type.
   - Note that by default, both html and althtml are ON.
   - Setting all export types OFF disables GMFF exports.
   - If OFF the rest of the input parameters are not validated
     or stored.
 
 - Value3     = Typesetting Definition Keyword in .mm file
               (in the $t typesetting comment) for this export.
   - defaults: althtmldef and htmldef (or latex but latex is
     not supported by the GMFF Model files provided and only
     Model A is coded into the program.)
 
 - Value4     = Export Directory.
   - defaults: gmff\althtml and gmff\html
   - Directory where exports are written. Also, gmff\html
     contains .gif files for symbols.
 
 - Value5     = export File Type
   - default: .html (.html or .htm might be good choices :-)
 
 - Value6     = GMFF Models Directory -- Directory containing
                html fragment files serving as models for exports.
   - defaults: gmff\althtml\models and GMFF\html\models
 
 - Value7     = Model Id. Only "A" is valid now.
   - defaults: Model Id."A"
 
 - Value8     = Charset Encoding name.
   - default: ISO-8859-1
   - Must match the html fragment for the specified Model Id
     which contains the html <head> keyword...but the program
     does not validate this! Model A specifies ISO-8859-1
     (same as Metamath Proof Explorer).
   - Valid charset encodings on all Java platforms are:
     - US-ASCII
     - ISO-8859-1
     - UTF-8
     - UTF-16BE
     - UTF-16LE
     - UTF-16
 
  - Value9 = OutputFileName 
 
              Name of output file minus the file type. 
              Optional. 
 
              - If not specified the output file name is 
                constructed from the proof theorem's label 
                + the Export File Type. 
 
                - Note! The OutputFileName applies to all 
                  exports, including those via the 
                  GMFFExportTheorem and GMFFExportFromFolder 
                  RunParms in addition to ProofAsstGUI 
                  export requests. To export to individual 
                  theorem-named files you must input a 
                  new GMFEExportTheorems RunParm!!! 
 
              - If specified must not contain any 
                whitespace characters, or '/' or '\' or ':' 
                characters (for safety.) 
 
                - All/any exported Proof Worksheets will be 
                  output to the named file suffixed with the 
                  GMFFExportParms file type -- except that 
                  the GMFFExportTheorem and 
                  GMFFExportFromFolder AppendFileName 
                  parameter overrides the OutputFileName 
                  parameter on the GMFFExportParms RunParm! 
 
 
 - NOTE: There is nothing in the GMFF program code specific
         to html. All html-specific information is external
         to the code, and is specified via the GMFF RunParms,
         the GMFF \models directory files, and the Metamath
         $t typesetting definitions.
 
         - Since mmj2 allows you to input more than one
           LoadFile RunParm, you could create an extra $t
           comment in a second input .mm file and output
           export data in whatever format you desire...
           the only proviso being that the GMFF code knows
           the names of the \models files for Model A. So
           either your extra export type must match the
           pattern of \models files (with regards to the
           parts which are filled in by the code vs. what
           is in the fragments), or another model would
           need to be added to the GMFF code.
 
           - Model A is a "minimalist" version of a webpage
             which typesets only proof step formulas plus the
             theorem label, which is output as text but is
             treated as a variable in the model.)
 
           - The one thing you cannot do with this design is
             export to a language which is based on the formula
             parse trees, for example MathML. Exporting and
             typesetting based on parse trees -- as opposed to
             formulas comprised of sequences of symbols -- would
             require extra code in GMFF.
 
      - Examples (these are the defaults):
         *       1         2         3         4
         *234567890123456789012345678901234567890

 SvcArg
 <p>
 
 <pre>
 "SvcArg": Key/Value Pair loaded into Map which is passed
           to SvcCallback.go(). Key/Value pairs are minimally
           validated to ensure that each Key is at least
           one character long and unique. The Key/Value parm
           contents are parsed using the same separator
           and delimter characters used for the rest of
           the RunParms. Multiple SvcArgs can be input.
 
 : - Optional.
 
  - Default = None.

 <pre>
 "SvcCallbackClass": Name of class which implements the
              mmj.svc.SvcCallback interface in "callee"
              mode. Must have a default constructor.
 
      NOTE: Do not input this RunParm if you are using
            SvcCallback in "caller" mode because it will
            override the specific instance of your class
            which you pass as an argument to
            BatchMMJ2.generateSvcCallback()
 
 : - Optional. SvcCallback can be provided via a call to
              BatchMMJ2.setSvcCallback().
 
  - Default = None.
 
  - Value1 = SvcCallbackClass class name.

 <pre>
 "SvcFolder": directory name, no "\" at end of name.
              Must exist and must be a directory.
 
 : - Optional. Must appear prior to the SvcCall RunParm.
 
  - Default = If not input, output Svc files are directed
              to the current directory.
 
  - Value1 = Directory Name. No "\" or "/" at the end
             of name. Must exist and must be the name of
             a directory. The separator symbol is OS 
             dependent (Windows uses "\", *nix/Max = "/").

 DeclareWorkVars command.
 
 <pre>
  - Optional. May appear anywhere after the "Parse" RunParm
              within an input, and takes effect immediately
              (any existing Work Variables are deleted and
              a new set is created.)
 
  - Default = A default DeclareWorkVars RunParm is executed
              automatically when first need arises (e.g. at
              Proof Assistant start-up), if none have been

 DefineWorkVarType command.
 
 <pre>
 : - Optional. May appear anywhere after the "Parse" RunParm
              within an input RunParm file, and takes effect
              when the next DeclareWorkVars RunParm command is
              processed. If not input prior to first use -- the
              Proof Assistant -- the default settings are
              automatically used.

  - Value2 = Work Variable Prefix for the grammatical
             Type Code. Must generate unique variable and
             variable hypothesis names when concatenated
             with the Work Variable numerical suffix (1,
             2, ..., 11, ..., etc.) Note that Work
             Variable Hypothesis labels are generated

             and less than 1000 ("stinginess" is recommended to
             avoid wasted processing and memory allocations...

 ProofAsstUnifySearchExclude
 <p>
 {@code 
 "ProofAsstUnifySearchExclude": options = Assrt labels, comma
                                separated (ex: biigb,xxxid)
 }
 <p>
 NOTE: The RunParm validation for these excluded Assrt labels will be very
 lenient and will just ignore labels that are "invalid" or not in the
 Statment Table. The reason is that the exclusion list is expected to be
 very stable and the new RunParm "LoadEndpointStmtNbr" allows loading of
 just a portion of a Metamath file; if we required perfection in the
 exclusion list the usability of LoadEndPointStmtNbr would drop
 dramatically (see also LoadEndpointStmtLabel).
 <p>
 This RunParm instructs ProofUnifier.java to not attempt to unify the
 specified assertion labels with any proof steps -- unless the user
 specifically enters them on a proof step.
 <p>
 The Unification process scans the loaded Metamath file assertion
 (LogicalSystem.stmtTbl) in ascending database sequence and accepts the
 first match it finds. Generally that works fine, but in a few cases, such
 as duplicate theorems that are present simply because of an alternate
 proof, this feature is helpful (though it would possibly be easier to put
 biigb after bii and avoid the situation in the first place.)
 <p>
 The *problem* of multiple valid unifications for a proof step may affect
 a small number of theorems. The list of alternatives can be obtained by
 specifically entering a valid assertion label that does *not* unify --
 the program then provides a message detailing the possible choices. (The
 message with alternatives is also produced if there is a Distinct
 Variables error on a proof step and there is no unifying assertion that
 doesn't have a Distinct Variables error.) In set.mm p0ex and snex are
 appear as alternatives in a few proofs; mulid1 and mulid2 are another
 example.

 This RunParm is provided for use in high-volume testing.
 <p>
 RunParm option value2 is input to specify an input file containing proofs
 in the format used on the Proof Assistant GUI screen. This is optional,
 and if not provided, the program simulates an input file using the
 currently loaded Metamath data
 <p>
 In "simulation" mode (no input file), the program exports a proof
 "to memory", just as it would have been created for the
 ProofAsstExportToFile RunParm (which is why the unified/un-unified and
 Randomized/ NotRandomized options are provided here also.) The The
 export-simulated proof is run through the Unification process for testing
 purposes. RunParm option value1 provides a selection capability, and this
 capability works with or without an input file. Specify "*" to test
 unification of all proofs, either in the input file or those loaded into
 the system. Specifying a number, for example 99, runs the test for the
 first 99 theorems (database sequence if input file not provided).
 Finally, specifying a theorem label runs the test for just that one
 theorem. Note: a relative filename such as "export.mmp" can be input or
 an "absolute" name such as "c:\my\export.mmp". The
 "ProofAsstProofFolder", if present, is used with relative filename. And
 take care to note that if export is performed *after* ProofAsstGUI, the
 ProofAsstProofFolder may have been changed.

 exported derivation proof steps do not have Ref labels,
 whereas unified means Ref labels are present.
 
 Note: this feature is not a full export of a Metamath
 file as it does not export $d or anything besides theorems
 and their logical hypotheses.

 formulas for legibility reasons.)
 
 Optional, default is 80 (see mmj.pa.PaConstants.java)
 </pre>
/

                        etc.
 One way to view the list of Font Family Names defined
 on a system is to input an invalid Font Family Name
 on the ProofAsstFontFamily command -- a list will be
 displayed as part of a punitively long error message :)
 
 NOTE!!! Fixed-width fonts such as Monospaced or Courier
         are essential for Proof Assistant if you plan
         on using the Text Mode Formula Formatting
         (TMFF) alignment Methods such as AlignColumn.
         TMFF will not align formula symbols properly
         when proportional fonts are used!!!
 
 Optional, default is "Monospaced"

 - Optional. Primarily used for testing. Exports Proof Worksheet
             file(s) from the loaded Metamath database using
             the current parameter settings (export parms, escapes, etc.)
 
             May appear anywhere after the "LoadFile" RunParm,
             but should appear after Proof Assistant parameters
             initialized if the default Proof Assistant settings
             are not used.
 
  - Default = N/A -- used for batch testing.
 
  - Value1 = theorem label or "*" (all). If theorem label
             input then it is the starting point of the
             export process, which will export the Max
             Number of files beginning at that label.
             If "*" input then the export begins at the
             first label. Either way, files are exported
             in MObj.seq number -- i.e. by order of appearance
             in the loaded Metamath database (LogicalSystem.)
 
  - Value2 = Max Number of proofs to export. Required.
 
  - Value3 = Append File Name. Name of output file minus
             the file type. Optional. If specified must
             not contain any whitespace characters, or '/'
             or '\' or ':' characters (for safety.) All
             exported Proof Worksheets will be appended
             to the named file (written at the end instead
             of the beginning.) Used for regression testing.
