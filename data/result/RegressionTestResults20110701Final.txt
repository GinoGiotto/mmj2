==> Difference caused by change in Stmt table size. No problem.
    Stmt table is stored in a HashSet, and the RunParm which triggered
    these messages is "VerifyProof,*", which processes the Stmt set
    in the physical order of the HashSet, not in order by Stmt label.
    Note that both tests processed the theorems of the input .mm file,
    mmj2\data\mm\EarleyParserExample.mm, out of order.

==> Differences. A lot. Result from Volume Test 2b deriving
Proof Worksheet formulas from the proof step labels and
randomized hypothesis numbers. The mmj2 Proof Unifier
doesn't require proof step hypotheses to be input in the
same order in which they appear in the original theorem.
If a hypothesis cannot be unified with the corresponding
hypothesis of the proof step label (Ref), unification is
attempted with the referenced label's other hypotheses.
In some rare circumstances, typically involving hypotheses
with variables not appearing in the conclusion formula,
unification is attempted and succeeds, but the assigned
variable(s) do not match the theorem's Dj Vars specifications --
and might not be valid in the context of other proof steps.
The Proof Unifier does not take Dj Vars into account when
it seeks unification matches of hypotheses. In Volume Test
2b, randomization is the factor causing errors, but only
for a small percentage of theorems.

Should probably look into why both versions of the software are
generating "Status = 9 = PROOF_STMT_PROVED_BUT_DJ_VARS_ERROR"
messages for some theorems. The CompareDJs and UpdateDJs RunParm
options should be creating the minimal set of DjVars based on the
input .mm axioms, so why are ANY errors being generated? (Since
the CompareDJs and UpdateDJs Runparm options are used only
in volume testing, resolving the "mystery" does not have high
priority, esp. since the new and old versions of the software
produce the same result.)
